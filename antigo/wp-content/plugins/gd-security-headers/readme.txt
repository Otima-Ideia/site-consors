Configure various security-related HTTP headers, including CSP, XSS, Referrer Policy and more.

== Description ==
Configure various security-related HTTP headers, including Content Security Policy, Feature Policy, Referrer Policy and more. For CSP and XSS plugin supports report logging with 2 additional database tables to store reports from browsers.

The plugin has support for following HTTP headers:

* Content Security Policy (CSP) - with reporting
* XSS Protection (XXP) - with reporting
* Feature Policy
* Content Type - No Sniff Policy
* Strict Transport Security
* Referrer Policy
* Frame Options

For CSP, the plugin allows you to set rules for all currently supported directives, additional settings including setting the policy in Report or Live mode. The plugin also includes special extensions that can automatically fill CSP rules for popular Google services you might be using on your website (Fonts, Maps, Adsense, Analytics and more) and other populare services (Gravatar, Vimeo and more).

And, for Feature Policy, the plugin allows you to set rules for all currently supported features.

The plugin can add all the generated headers into HTACCESS file (for Apache web servers), and they will be applied to all files, not just WordPress generated content. If your website is not using Apache (or .HTACCESS), all rules are generated with each page request and will work with any server type.

And, if you don't use Apache web server, plugin has a panel where it displays generated headers for most popular servers: Apache, Nginx and IIS, and you can copy generated headers to add to server configuration files.
